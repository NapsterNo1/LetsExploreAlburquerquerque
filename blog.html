									<p>Asin Tibuok was  Given as rich Bolonano identity. In the course of Bohol’s history, salt was one of the most important trade products since the 16th century.  It was used to barter rice from the uplands. Since then, salt has become one of the island’s products, with each town having different styles of making salt. Out of the four, only Alburqueque continues the salt-making industry because of its long process and low income return.
									Asin Tibuok or “whole salt” has a fine texture because of the very small granules. It has a mild, smoky, fruity taste, and is presented in a clay pot. It is pinkish in color due to intense heat but when washed with water, it turns white. It is described as “the purest and cleanest artisanal sea-salt.
